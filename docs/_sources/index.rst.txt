In Data Science modeling, sometimes would like to ...

* Use various search algorithms on the same interface.

* Optimize parameters and feature selections simultaneously.

* Integrate log management and its visualization into search API.

To make these simpler, cvopt was created (`GitHub <https://github.com/genfifth/cvopt>`_).
